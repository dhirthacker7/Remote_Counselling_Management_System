# Remote_Counselling_Management_System (Streamlining Client and Counselor Interactions) | MSSQL, PL-SQL, Tableau  

## Overview

In today's fast-paced society, mental well-being often doesn't receive the attention it deserves. The hustle and bustle of modern life have led to a significant rise in mental health issues, underscoring the need for effective mental healthcare and counselling systems. Many individuals hesitate to seek therapy due to the discomfort of discussing their issues in person. A remote counselling system can bridge this gap by providing accessible mental health support.

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a comprehensive database solution using MSSQL Server, PL/SQL, and data visualization with Tableau to support a remote counselling management system. The system is designed to facilitate seamless interactions between clients and counselors, manage appointments, and track progress, all within a secure and user-friendly environment.

## Repository Contents

- **CREATE TABLE.sql**: SQL script containing the commands to create the necessary database tables for the system.

- **DATABASE OBJECTS.sql**: SQL script defining various database objects such as stored procedures, views, and functions essential for the system's operations.

- **INSERT QUERIES.sql**: SQL script with sample data insertion queries to populate the database tables for testing and demonstration purposes.

- **final ER diagram.drawio.png**: An Entity-Relationship diagram illustrating the database schema, showcasing the relationships between different entities within the system.

- **Tableau Dashboard Version 1.0.pdf**: A PDF document presenting the initial version of the Tableau dashboard, providing visual insights into the system's data and performance metrics.
