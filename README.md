In the current rapid paced society, mental well being is something that is not valued as much as it should be. The hustle and bustle of modern life has contributed to a significant rise in mental health issues which has in turn established the need for better mental healthcare/counselling systems. 


Mental trauma is a common issue faced by people irrespective of their age and is relatable to everyone. Off late, the importance of mental well-being is being significantly recognized. Unaddressed mental trauma leads to severe depression and also suicidal thoughts. Many people consider not going to therapy because they can’t face discussing their issues in person. In that case, a remote counselling system would be of huge help.


•	Developed a complete MSSQL server database solution and created an online counseling system, performing CRUD operations. 

•	The project consists of an Entity Relationship Diagram, based on which a SQL server database has been designed. Database objects like stored procedures, user-defined functions (UDFs), views, triggers, non-clustered indexes, and data encryption, have been created and data visualization has been carried out by creating a tableau dashboard for a better understanding of the data.
